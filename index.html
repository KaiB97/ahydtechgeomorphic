    <h1>Coastal Engineering</h1>
    <p>Coastal Engineering is the branch of civil engineering, which involves the
        processes ongoing at the shoreline, design and construction within the coastal zone. The
        hydrodynamic impacts of waves, wind-waves, tides, storm surge and tsunamis on the shoreline and
        near coastal zone are integral parts of the coastal engineering study. AHYDTECH senior coastal
        engineer has experience in Shoreline Management, Permit and Approval from the regulating
        agencies, determination of Erosion and Flooding Hazard Limits, Shoreline Erosion Protection,
        preparation of Shoreline Structure Inventory, design of Seawall, Breakwall, Revetment and Groin,
        Marina Structure, and the implementation of waterfront projects including 2D and 3D hydrodynamic
        and sediment transport modelling using XBEACH, ADCIRC Vamp; TUFLOW software.</p>

                    <p> Coastal barriers offer improved wave absorption and deflection, for shoreline
                        management and to protect public and private property from erosion and
                        scour. AHYDTECH is experienced creating conceptual and detailed design of
                        shoreline projects. Our staff collects topographic and bathymetry site data with
                        RTK/GPS and ECO sounder technologies, to ensure the best possible design.
                        We prepare Seawall, Breaking Wall and Revetment design for shoreline
                        erosion protection. Groin design can offer additional wave dispersion to the
                        shoreline structures. Using shoreline structural condition assessment,
                        AHYDTECH will identify elements which can safely be repaired or reused to
                        reduce building costs. Construction supervision and administration will be
                        provided. The company is experience with consulting and achieving approval
                        and permitting from MNR and Conservation Authorities.</p>

                    <p>When building of a new or an extension of coastal property, it is necessary to
                        assess erosion and flooding potential. Regulating Agency (Conservation
                        Authority) requires erosion and flooding hazard lines be delineated to ensure
                        safety of life and property. The MNRF needs yearly erosion rates and slope
                        stability to be accounted for in the delineation. Wave uprush prediction is
                        conducted to assess the site specific flood potential. AHYDTECH staff
                        conduct topographic and geomorphic assessment to ensure accurate
                        delineation of the hazard limits. Any planned extension cannot be built beyond
                        this line, it is best to have a line created before having building plans drawn.</p>

    <p>AHYDTECH Geomorphic staff has highly qualified expertise in fluvial geomorphology. 
        The company is dedicated to providing services on critical issues of fluvial processes 
        in natural environments. AHYDTECH staff have experience in the following fluvial geomorphology
         methods:</p>

        <div class="accordion">

                <div class = "label"> Natural Channel Design-Channel Restoration </div>
                <div class = "content">
                    <p> Natural Channel Design (NCD) involves techniques to restore or replicate
                        fluvial geomorphic forms, functions and processes of a stream channel
                        through field geomorphic assessment, conceptual design and detail design.
                        NCD is the application of fluvial geomorphology to design and construct stable
                        channels that do not aggrade or degrade over time. This will maximize stream
                        functions given site constraints, which supports aquatic and riparian
                        ecosystems of composition and quality. NCD uses hydrology, hydraulic and
                        fluvial geomorphic responses, bankfull and/or reference reach parameters to
                        determine design parameters through utilizing complex and inter-related
                        processes of aquatic and riparian ecosystem. The AHYDTECH staff
                        possesses a broad knowledge and extensive experience in conceptual and

                    <p>Rivers and streams have natural fluvial processes to migrate in lateral and
                        longitudinal directions. The Meander Belt Width Assessment is a technique for
                        planning and determining hazard limits for managing the risk of life and
                        property due to river erosion and migration. The meander belt assessment
                        includes reach delineation, planform determination and meandering geometry
                        assessment. This technique is applied in Subwatershed Studies, SWM
                        Development Limit studies, Watercourse Re-naturalization, Bridge/Culvert
                        Replacement and Installation and Municipal Infrastructure Installation

                        migration rate is determined to estimate the erosion setback. AHYDTECH has

                        are qualitative techniques based on the presence and/or the absence of key
