            <p> AHYDTECH Water Resources (BD) Ltd. is a sister organization in Bangladesh working 
                in water resources, river morphology, hydrology and hydraulic. We are working on all 
                the rivers and river systems of Bangladesh including the Padma, Meghna and 
                Brahmaputra-Jamuna basins. We have been developing HEC-HMS hydrological models for the 
                three major basins – Ganges (1,087,300 Km 2 ), Brahmaputra-Jamuna (552,000 Km 2 ), and Meghna 
                (82,000 Km 2 ). These three basins together are one of the largest river basin systems of the world.
                 The HEC-HMS models are being calibrated using observed flow data. The calibrated models will be used
                  to simulate flows at subbasin outlets for water resources management, river dredging analysis, 
                  river morphology and bank erosion assessment, hydraulic and sediment transport analysis, natural 
                  channel design and river training.</p>

            <p> Coastal barriers offer improved wave absorption and deflection, for shoreline
                management and to protect public and private property from erosion and
                scour. AHYDTECH is experienced creating conceptual and detailed design of
                shoreline projects. Our staff collects topographic and bathymetry site data with
                RTK/GPS and ECO sounder technologies, to ensure the best possible design.
                We prepare Seawall, Breaking Wall and Revetment design for shoreline
                erosion protection. Groin design can offer additional wave dispersion to the
                shoreline structures. Using shoreline structural condition assessment,
                AHYDTECH will identify elements which can safely be repaired or reused to
                reduce building costs. Construction supervision and administration will be
                provided. The company is experience with consulting and achieving approval
                and permitting from MNR and Conservation Authorities.</p>

                and Meghna River) in Bangladesh. We have developed a 2D Sediment Transport and River Morphology Model
                 of the Jamuna River. AHYDTECH has created a conceptual Natural Channel & River Training Design of 160
                  Km long the Jamuna River from Gaibandha to the Padma River confluence. The 2D Sediment Transport 
                  Model can be used for the detailed design of the Jamuna River Natural Channel and River Training

                and implementation of waterfront. The company has experience in following types of coastal engineering
                 projects: Shoreline Inventory, Shoreline Structural Condition Assessment, Bathymetry Data Collection,
                  2D and 3D hydrodynamic, Sediment Transport and Water Quality Modeling, Shoreline Erosion and Dynamic
                   Beach Analysis, Shoreline Design and Protection Works, and Water Quality Modeling and Analysis. 
                   We apply estuarine and coastal processes including hydrodynamics, wind-wave actions, wave 
                   transformation, refraction, diffraction, shoaling, and breaking waves for understanding, 
                   analyzing, and designing for our coastal engineering projects. AHYDTECH provides planning 
                   and design services, construction supervision and administration including tidal marsh 
                   restoration, bio-engineered and breakwater structure design services. We use innovative 
                   technique including GPS, GNSS, total station, ECO sounder, boat and remote control boat

            <p> AHYDTECH has extensive experience in hydrologic modeling. The company’s engineers have developed 
                stochastic and deterministic models including lumped and physically distributed hydrologic models 
                for aids in understanding, predicting, and managing water resources. We have used HEC-HMS, SWMHYMO, 
                PCSWMM, SWMM, HSP-F, GAWSER, MIKE SHE, MIKE 11 NAM, & VISUAL OTTHYMO software to develop single 
                rainfall event and continuous models. The hydrologic models are calibrated using observed flow data. 
                The models use precipitation, temperature, soil, surficial geology, landuse/land cover and 
                evapotranspiration data, reservoir/dam storage- discharge-volume rating curves, and IDF curves.</p>

                AHYDTECH developed numerous 1D/2D Hydraulic, Water Quality and Sediment Transport models. 
                AHYDTECH senior engineer developed a 2D hydrodynamic code in FORTRAN to study the “Cohesive River 
                Bank Erosion Mechanism”. The model was calibrated using measured flow data. AHYDTECH develop 
                hydraulic models to determine the aerial extents and inundation depths of flooding. 
                Senior Engineer Dr. Bahar SM is the lead for development of hydraulic model. 
                AHYDTECH use 1D Hydraulic Model using several software (HEC-RAS, PCSWMM, SWMM5, 
                SWMM, MIKE 11) and 2D Hydraulic Model (SRH-2D, 2D HEC-RAS 5, RMA2, FESWMS, TUFLOW, STWAVE, 
                ADCIRC, MIKE 21). We do floodplain characterization and comment on the degree of flood risk 
                under the various return period events (5, 25, 50, 100 and 350 years) including the Regulatory event. 
                Factors to consider in the assessment include, but not be limited to; frequency of flooding, flooding 
                limits, depth, velocity, V*D product and water surface elevations.</p>
